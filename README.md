## Project Overview

This repository implements a data pipeline designed to analyze and visualize real-time data streams from a web application I developed. The web application facilitates a multiplayer rock-paper-scissors game enhanced with machine learning capabilities.

### Pipeline Components

The pipeline includes the following key components:

- **Data Extraction**: Utilizes custom APIs from the "SpokeLizard" web application ðŸ¦Ž to extract game data in real-time.

- **Data Transformation and Collection**: Logstash is configured to collect and transform raw game data into a structured format suitable for further processing.

- **Data Processing**: Apache Kafka manages data streams, ensuring reliable messaging and scalability as data moves through the pipeline.

- **Real-time Analytics**: Apache Spark performs distributed data processing, applying machine learning models to analyze gameplay patterns and outcomes in real-time.

- **Data Storage and Indexing**: Elasticsearch indexes processed data, enabling fast search and retrieval capabilities for analysis and reporting.

- **Data Visualization**: Kibana is employed to create interactive dashboards and visualizations, providing insights into gameplay trends, player behavior, and machine learning model performance.

### Usage

To deploy and use this pipeline:

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local environment.
   
2. **Configuration**: Adjust configuration files (`logstash.conf`, `spark-config`, etc.) as per your environment setup and requirements.

3. **Deploy**: Deploy and configure Logstash, Kafka, Spark(spark setting is not present because git did not make me load the folder), Elasticsearch, and Kibana in your environment.

4. **Run Pipeline**: Start the pipeline components in the specified order to begin streaming and analyzing data from the "SpokeLizard" web application.

5. **Monitor and Visualize**: Access Kibana to monitor real-time analytics and visualize insights derived from the gameplay data.

### Notes

- Ensure proper network configurations and security measures are in place, especially when handling real-time data streams and sensitive gameplay information.

- Regularly monitor pipeline performance and optimize configurations for efficient data processing and analysis.
